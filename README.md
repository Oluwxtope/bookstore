# Welcome to Bookstore üìö

Bookstore is a full-stack web application designed to help you manage and track the unique books in your library. With its robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, Bookstore allows you to efficiently manage your collection by adding new books, viewing details, updating information, and removing books from your library.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

This project leverages a modern stack of technologies to ensure scalability, performance, and a great developer experience:

- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js**: The runtime environment that powers the backend logic.
  - **Express**: A minimalist web framework used to build the RESTful API.
  - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store the book data.
  - **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, enabling schema-based modeling of the application data.
  - **Postman**: Utilized for API testing and interaction during development.

- **Frontend**:
  - **React.js**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, ensuring a responsive and dynamic user experience.
  - **Vite**: A fast and modern build tool that significantly improves the development workflow by providing instant hot module replacement (HMR) and faster builds.
  - **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client used to make requests to the backend API.
  - **React Router DOM**: Facilitates navigation between different views of the application, providing a seamless single-page application (SPA) experience.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used to style the application with ease, allowing for rapid UI development.

- **Development Tools**:
  - **Storybook**: An open-source tool for building UI components in isolation, enabling developers to create, test, and showcase components independently from the application.

By integrating these technologies, Bookstore ensures a robust, maintainable, and scalable application that can be easily extended with additional features in the future.
